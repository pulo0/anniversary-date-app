# anniversary_date_app

## Description

Simple anniversary date app, where you check since how much time certain date, event happened.
Pretty simple right?
Because it is.

Project uses (and will be implemented in the
future) [FCM](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) (Firebase Cloud Messaging) to send
users
notifications, reminders to go back and check the app.
